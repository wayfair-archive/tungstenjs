# Tungsten.js + Backbone ES6 TodoMVC Example

Example application showing how [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) can be implemented with Tungsten.js and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), implemented with ES6/ES2015.

Note: there's currently [no good solution](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3560) to handling Backbone + ES6 classes, so class properties are currently attached via the prototype.
